History
Formation and early years
In 1976, a group of eight engineers, all former employees of Delhi Cloth & General Mills, led by Shiv Nadar, started a company that would make personal computers.[7][8] Initially floated as Microcomp Limited, Nadar and his team (which also included Arjun Malhotra, Ajai Chowdhry, D.S. Puri, Yogesh Vaidya and Subhash Arora) started selling teledigital calculators to gather capital for their main product. On 11 August 1976, the company was renamed Hindustan Computers Limited (HCL).[9] HCL Enterprise developed an indigenous microcomputer in 1978,[10] and a RDBMS, networking OS and client-server architecture in 1983.[11] HCL Technologies began as the R&D division of HCL Enterprise.[11]

The company originally was focused on hardware but, via HCL Technologies, software and services became the main focus.[12][13] On 12 November 1991, HCL Technologies was spun off as a separate unit,[14] being incorporated as HCL Overseas Limited, a provider of software and technology development services.[15]

In 1993, HCL also started providing enterprise IT infrastructure management services, winning an order to establish India's first floorless, electronic stock exchange for NSE.[15][16]

In July 1994, the company name was changed to HCL Consulting Limited.[15] On 6 October 1999, the company was renamed 'HCL Technologies Limited' for "a better reflection of its activities."[15]

Between 1991 and 1999, the company expanded its software development capacities to US, European and APAC markets.[15]
