History
Infosys was founded by seven engineers in Pune, Maharashtra, India, with an initial capital of $250.[9] It was registered as Infosys Consultants Private Limited on 2 July 1981.[10] In 1983, it relocated to Bangalore, Karnataka.

The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and became Infosys Technologies Limited when it became a public limited company in June 1992.[11] In June 2011, the company was renamed Infosys Limited.[12]

In February 1993, Infosys launched its initial public offering (IPO) with an offer price of ₹95 per share, compared to a book value of ₹20 per share. The IPO was initially undersubscribed but was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which acquired a 13% equity stake at the offer price.[13] When trading began in June 1993, the share price opened at ₹145 per share.[14]

Infosys shares were listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 1999 as American depositary receipts (ADRs), making it the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq.[citation needed] The share price rose to ₹8,100 by 1999, making it the most expensive share on the market at the time. Infosys was then among the top 20 companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq.[13] The ADR listing was later transferred from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext to provide European investors with better access to the company's shares.[15]

In July 2010, then-British Prime Minister David Cameron visited Infosys HQ in Bangalore and addressed the company's employees.[16]
