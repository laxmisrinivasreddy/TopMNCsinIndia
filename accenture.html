        Accenture plc is an Irish-American professional services company headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, that specializes in information technology (IT) services and consulting. A Fortune Global 500 company, it reported revenues of $64.1 billion in 2024.[1]

History
Formation and early years
Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen in the early 1950s. <br>[2] The division conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky, which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer, believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the United States.[3][4]

Split from Arthur Andersen
In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC). <br> Throughout the 1990s, tensions grew between the two units. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC, pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting. This dispute came to a head in 1998, when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In 2000, as a result of arbitration, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid $1.2 billion to Arthur Andersen and changed its name to Accenture.[5]

On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted the name, "Accenture".  <br>The word "Accenture" was derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office. Petersen felt that the name should represent the firm's desire to be a global consulting leader and high performer,[6] and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates, because the word itself was meaningless.[7]
