        Wipro Limited (/ˈvɪproʊ/ ⓘ; stylized in lowercase title) is an Indian multinational technology company that provides information technology, consulting and business process services. It is one of the six leading Indian Big Tech companies. Wipro's capabilities range across cloud computing, computer security, digital transformation, artificial intelligence, robotics, data analytics, and other technologies, servicing customers in 167 countries.[4]

History
Early years
The company was incorporated on 29 December 1945 in Amalner by MH Hasham Premji as Western India Vegetable Products Limited, a manufacturer of cooking oils.[5][6][7] In 1966, after Hasham Premji's death, his son Azim Premji dropped out of Stanford University and took over as chairperson at age 21.[8]

The company changed its name to Wipro Products Limited in 1977, followed by Wipro Limited, a syllabic abbreviation of the original name, in 1982.[6]

Shift to IT
In the 1980s, recognizing opportunities in computer hardware and software, the company established subsidiaries Wipro Infotech and Wipro Systems. In 1981, Wipro developed the first Indian minicomputer based on the Intel 8086 chip in an IISc lab.[9][10] The software division began in 1984 with the development of a spreadsheet and word-processing suite but shifted to offshore software development in 1990.[11]

By the mid-1990s, Wipro had become one of India's leading manufacturers of personal computers, peripherals, and medical diagnostic equipment.[12] In 1998, the company reported being the second-largest software exporter from India,[13] and gradually increased its focus on the higher-margin software services business which accounted for the vast majority of its profits.[14]
